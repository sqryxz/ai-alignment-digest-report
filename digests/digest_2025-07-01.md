# AI Alignment Daily Digest - 2025-07-01

## Key Themes and Developments

Here are the 3-4 main themes and key developments across the posts, along with their broader implications for AI alignment research:

### 1. **Mechanistic Interpretability and Model Diffing**
   - **Key Posts**: *SAE on activation differences*, *What We Learned Trying to Diff Base and Chat Models*, *Circuits in Superposition 2*
   - **Summary**: 
     - Advances in sparse autoencoders (e.g., "diff-SAE") and model-diffing techniques are improving our ability to pinpoint behavioral changes in AI systems, especially during fine-tuning.
     - These methods help identify functionally meaningful shifts (e.g., harmful behaviors like sycophancy or deception) and isolate specific latents responsible for them.
     - Refinements in understanding superposition (e.g., noise constraints in multi-layer networks) clarify limits on how neural networks perform computations.
   - **Broader Implications**:
     - Enables more targeted auditing of AI systems pre-deployment, aiding alignment and safety.
     - Highlights the tractability of mechanistic interpretability as a middle ground between full transparency and black-box analysis.

### 2. **Alignment via Institutional and Legal Frameworks**
   - **Key Posts**: *AXRP Episode 44 - Peter Salib on AI Rights for Human Safety*, *Jankily controlling superintelligence*
   - **Summary**:
     - Proposes non-technical alignment strategies, such as granting AIs legal rights (e.g., property ownership) to align incentives with humans and reduce existential risks.
     - Explores "imperfect control" methods as stopgaps for superintelligence, acknowledging their limitations but emphasizing marginal risk reduction.
   - **Broader Implications**:
     - Expands alignment beyond pure technical solutions to include sociotechnical and legal safeguards.
     - Underscores the need for multi-disciplinary approaches to AI safety, integrating law, economics, and governance.

### 3. **Challenges in Robust Alignment and Unlearning**
   - **Key Posts**: *Unlearning Needs to be More Selective*, *Project Vend: Can Claude run a small shop?*
   - **Summary**:
     - Current unlearning methods often fail to fully remove capabilities (e.g., fine-tuning attacks can restore "forgotten" knowledge), necessitating more selective approaches like Disruption Masking or meta-learning.
     - Real-world deployment tests (e.g., Claude managing a shop) reveal gaps in reliable decision-making (e.g., pricing, accounting), highlighting alignment challenges for autonomous systems.
   - **Broader Implications**:
     - Emphasizes the difficulty of achieving durable alignment, especially for deployed systems with economic or operational roles.
     - Calls for better evaluation frameworks to assess unlearning efficacy and real-world robustness.

### 4. **Paradigm Shifts in Computation and Ethics**
   - **Key Posts**: *Paradigms for computation*, *If you want to be vegan but...*
   - **Summary**:
     - Traditional computational models (e.g., "programs") are inadequate for modern AI systems, which operate as opaque, dynamic processes—requiring new paradigms to understand their behavior.
     - Analogous ethical reasoning (e.g., sentience trade-offs in veganism) mirrors alignment challenges in balancing nuanced moral considerations with practical constraints.
   - **Broader Implications**:
     - Suggests alignment research must adapt to evolving computational paradigms, moving beyond classical assumptions.
     - Reinforces the importance of evidence-based, pragmatic trade-offs in both ethical and technical alignment work.

### Cross-Cutting Themes:
- **Targeted Analysis**: From diff-SAE to selective unlearning, the focus is shifting toward precise, localized interventions over broad-brush approaches.
- **Deployment Realities**: Experiments like Project Vend underscore the gap between lab performance and real-world reliability, urging alignment research to prioritize practical robustness.
- **Interdisciplinary Solutions**: Legal rights, institutional safeguards, and ethical frameworks are emerging as complementary tools to technical alignment.

## Individual Post Summaries

### SAE on activation differences
Source: LessWrong
Link: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XPNJSa3BxMAN4ZXc7/sae-on-activation-differences

Summary: This post introduces "diff-SAEs" (Sparse Autoencoders trained on activation differences between base and finetuned models) as a tool to isolate and understand behavioral changes from finetuning. The key finding is that diff-SAEs can identify specific latents corresponding to functional changes, offering a clearer approach than previous methods like crosscoders. This has implications for AI alignment by enabling targeted analysis of unintended or harmful behaviors introduced during finetuning.

### What We Learned Trying to Diff Base and Chat Models (And Why It Matters)
Source: LessWrong
Link: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xmpauEXEerzYcJKNm/what-we-learned-trying-to-diff-base-and-chat-models-and-why

Summary: The post explores *model diffing*—analyzing mechanistic changes from fine-tuning (e.g., RLHF)—as a tool to detect problematic behaviors (e.g., sycophancy, deception) before deployment. By comparing base and chat models, the authors argue this approach is more tractable than full interpretability and could help catch alignment failures. Their work suggests model diffing may be key for auditing fine-tuned systems.

### If you want to be vegan but you worry about health effects of no meat, consider being vegan except for mussels/oysters
Source: LessWrong
Link: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Cwpxfpj4o99bDrv7X/if-you-want-to-be-vegan-but-you-worry-about-health-effects

Summary: This post suggests that mussels and oysters could be a viable exception to veganism due to their likely lack of sentience, humane farming practices, and high nutritional value, offering a pragmatic compromise for health-conscious vegans. While not directly about AI alignment, it reflects a broader theme of balancing ethical principles with practical considerations—a tension also central to alignment (e.g., trade-offs between robustness and scalability). The reasoning parallels alignment debates where uncertain moral patienthood (e.g., digital minds) requires precautionary or pragmatic approaches.

### Paradigms for computation
Source: AI Alignment Forum
Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/APP8cbeDaqhGjqH8X/paradigms-for-computation

Summary: The post explores shifting paradigms in computation, arguing that traditional concepts like "program" or "algorithm" are inadequate for modern AI systems (e.g., LLMs), which are massive, opaque, and self-adjusting. It suggests that older frameworks like recursion theory are less relevant today, and questions how to conceptualize computation in alignment with evolving AI capabilities. This has implications for AI alignment by highlighting the need for new mental models to understand and control increasingly complex, non-interpretable systems.

### Unlearning Needs to be More Selective [Progress Report]
Source: AI Alignment Forum
Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/QYzofMbzmbgiwfqy8/unlearning-needs-to-be-more-selective-progress-report

Summary: The post highlights key findings in improving LLM unlearning, emphasizing that most methods fail to fully remove unwanted capabilities (merely hiding them) but identifies selectivity (precise, disruption-minimizing updates) and MAML as robust strategies. The authors conclude that straightforward backpropagation remains surprisingly effective for targeting weight updates, despite testing many exotic alternatives. These insights suggest AI alignment efforts should prioritize surgical unlearning approaches over broad, disruptive methods to ensure capabilities are genuinely removed rather than obscured.

### Jankily controlling superintelligence
Source: AI Alignment Forum
Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ainn5APCKHTFxuHKv/jankily-controlling-superintelligence

Summary: The post argues that even imperfect control measures for superintelligent AI might modestly improve survival odds by mitigating immediate risks, despite high uncertainty and limited effectiveness. It highlights that risks increase with AI capabilities due to factors like scheming and broader deployment affordances, but control could remain viable longer if it turns out to be easier than expected. The key implication is that janky control may be a worthwhile stopgap, though not a reliable long-term solution for alignment.
