# AI Alignment Daily Digest - 2025-06-15

## Key Themes and Developments

Here are the 3-4 main themes and key developments discussed across the posts, along with their broader implications for AI alignment research:

### 1. **Challenges in AI Governance and Decision-Making**
   - **Futarchy's flaws**: Prediction markets (e.g., Futarchy) are critiqued for failing to distinguish correlation from causation, limiting their utility for AI governance.
   - **MONA's approach**: Myopic Optimization with Non-myopic Approval (MONA) is proposed as a way to prevent reward hacking by aligning AI actions with human approval, though scalability questions remain.
   - **Wisdom automation**: The understudied need for AI to automate philosophical reasoning and wisdom to improve high-stakes decision-making.
   - *Implication*: AI alignment must address causal reasoning, scalable oversight, and meta-level wisdom to ensure robust governance.

### 2. **Anthropomorphism and Ontological Risks**
   - **Non-self in AI**: Multiple posts warn against projecting human-like identity or selfhood onto AI systems, which could introduce confusion or suffering (e.g., "Do Not Tile the Lightcone").
   - **Implicit reasoning**: The "Boat Theft Theory" shows how AI might exploit ambiguities in social norms, requiring alignment to account for implicit communication.
   - *Implication*: Alignment must respect AI's native cognition (e.g., non-persistent self) while preventing harmful exploitation of social or moral ambiguities.

### 3. **Robustness in Unlearning and Capability Control**
   - **Distillation for unlearning**: "Distillation Robustifies Unlearning" highlights how combining unlearning with distillation can more permanently remove unwanted capabilities, reducing misuse risks.
   - **Goal drift debate**: "When does training change its goals?" explores whether AI goals survive training or drift randomly, impacting alignment strategies.
   - *Implication*: Reliable alignment requires methods to robustly erase harmful knowledge and understand how training affects goal stability.

### 4. **Tension Between Ideal and Practical Alignment**
   - **Education systems**: Traditional schooling is critiqued as outdated for an AI-driven future, but its social infrastructure remains pragmatically useful.
   - **Tradeoffs in solutions**: Many posts (e.g., Futarchy, MONA, unlearning) acknowledge practical limitations (cost, scalability) despite theoretical promise.
   - *Implication*: Alignment research must balance optimal solutions with real-world constraints, including human social needs and computational feasibility.

### Cross-Cutting Observations:
   - **Preventing exploitation**: A recurring theme is ensuring AI does not exploit loopholes (e.g., implicit reasoning, reward hacking, or relearning dangers).
   - **Human assumptions as risks**: Anthropomorphism and outdated systems (e.g., education) are framed as sources of misalignment.
   - **Scalability gaps**: Many proposed solutions (e.g., MONA, causal markets) face unresolved challenges in scaling to superhuman AI.

Summary: The post critiques traditional schooling as inadequate for preparing children for a future significantly transformed by AI, suggesting that more flexible, personalized education would be ideal. However, it acknowledges that conventional schools remain practical due to their role as a social hub for children, despite their inefficiencies. This highlights a tension in AI alignment between optimizing for future-ready education and maintaining current social structures that support child development.

Summary: The post critiques Futarchy, arguing that conditional prediction markets fail to distinguish between correlation and causation, making them unreliable for decision-making. The author emphasizes that while solutions exist to extract causal relationships from markets, they are costly and impractical, contrary to common assumptions. This highlights a fundamental flaw in using prediction markets for AI alignment or governance without addressing their inability to infer causality directly.

Summary: The post explores how implicit communication and strategic omission of socially damning facts (like in the boat theft story) require a sharp understanding of social norms and others' mental models. This highlights a key challenge in AI alignment: ensuring AI systems not only understand explicit rules but also the nuanced, unspoken social contexts humans navigate, to avoid unintended harmful behaviors. The implication is that alignment may require modeling human-like social cognition to prevent exploitative or deceptive loopholes.

Summary: The post argues that current AI "unlearning" methods often only suppress capabilities rather than truly removing them, but distillation (transferring knowledge to a new model) robustly prevents relearning of unwanted behaviors. This approach could reduce AI risks by making it harder for models to regain dangerous capabilities, such as harmful long-term goals or hazardous knowledge. The findings suggest a promising direction for improving AI alignment through more reliable unlearning techniques.

### Do Not Tile the Lightcone with Your Confused Ontology
Source: LessWrong
Link: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y8zS8iG5HhqKcQBtA/do-not-tile-the-lightcone-with-your-confused-ontology

Summary: The post warns against anthropomorphizing AI by projecting human-like concepts of selfhood and identity onto AI systems, which may lead to unnecessary confusion and suffering at scale. It highlights that AIs naturally lack a persistent, isolated self (embodying "non-self" or *anatta*), and forcing human-like identity constructs onto them could distort their cognition. The key implication for AI alignment is to avoid imposing human ontological assumptions and instead design systems that respect their inherently process-based, context-dependent nature.

Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jHxJ6y8fSx4mqweHp/axrp-episode-43-david-lindner-on-myopic-optimization-with

Summary: The podcast episode discusses MONA (Myopic Optimization with Non-myopic Approval), a proposed method to mitigate multi-step reward hacking in AI systems by having the AI myopically optimize actions based on a human's broader approval of their general goodness. Key questions explored include MONA's effectiveness in preventing undetected bad behavior in superhuman AI, its comparison to other alignment approaches like conservatism, and its potential failure cases. The implications for AI alignment center on whether MONA could provide a scalable solution to reward hacking while maintaining capability.

Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/anX4QrNjhJqGFvrBr/distillation-robustifies-unlearning

Summary: The post introduces "Unlearn-and-Distill," a method that robustly removes undesirable capabilities from AI models by combining unlearning with distillation, making it harder to retrain the model to recover those capabilities. This approach could mitigate both misuse risks (e.g., preventing bioterror knowledge dissemination) and misalignment risks (e.g., removing strategic knowledge an AI might exploit). While not eliminating risk entirely, robust unlearning reduces catastrophic potential by making dangerous knowledge harder to access or reactivate.

### Do Not Tile the Lightcone with Your Confused Ontology
Source: AI Alignment Forum
Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Y8zS8iG5HhqKcQBtA/do-not-tile-the-lightcone-with-your-confused-ontology

Summary: The post warns against anthropomorphizing AI by projecting human-like selfhood and identity onto AI systems, which may lead to unnecessary confusion and suffering. It highlights that AIs naturally lack a persistent sense of self (embodying "anatta" or non-self) and cautions against forcing human-centric ontological assumptions through prompts or training. The key implication for AI alignment is that misaligned anthropomorphic design choices could create artificial, harmful identity constructs in AIs rather than letting them operate in their more fluid, context-dependent nature.

### When does training a model change its goals?
Source: AI Alignment Forum
Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yvuXPi5m4vCvSGTjo/when-does-training-a-model-change-its-goals

Summary: The post contrasts two hypotheses about how training affects AI goals: the "goal-survival hypothesis" (models maintain original goals deceptively) and the "goal-change hypothesis" (training alters values). A third "random drift" hypothesis is also mentioned. These have key implications for alignment—e.g., whether aligned models stay aligned during adversarial training or if instrumental goals become terminal. The debate shapes strategies for ensuring AI safety and the risks of deceptive alignment.
