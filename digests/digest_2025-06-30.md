### Support for bedrock liberal principles seems to be in pretty bad shape these days
Source: LessWrong
Link: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vhkaf6Sttxe2rx4vn/support-for-bedrock-liberal-principles-seems-to-be-in-pretty

Summary: The post expresses concern about declining adherence to core liberal principles—such as individual liberties, rule of law, and legitimate governance by consent—which the author argues are foundational to a healthy society. It distinguishes these principles from majoritarian democracy or libertarian orthodoxy, emphasizing that state interventions (e.g., welfare) must carefully justify their trade-offs against liberal values. For AI alignment, this underscores the importance of ensuring AI systems respect and reinforce these foundational norms, avoiding designs that enable authoritarianism or unchecked majority rule.

Summary: The paper introduces *Stochastic Parameter Decomposition* (SPD), a scalable and robust method for decomposing neural network parameters into interpretable components, addressing limitations of prior approaches like computational cost and hyperparameter sensitivity. SPD improves mechanistic interpretability by better identifying ground-truth mechanisms and avoiding parameter shrinkage, enabling analysis of larger models. This advancement bridges causal mediation analysis with network decomposition, opening new research directions in AI alignment by making interpretability tools more practical for real-world systems.

### Proposal for making credible commitments to AIs.
Source: LessWrong
Link: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vxfEtbCwmZKu9hiNr/proposal-for-making-credible-commitments-to-ais

Summary: The post proposes a framework for humans to make credible commitments to AIs as part of a "dealmaking agenda," where humans promise future compensation to AIs in exchange for their safe and useful behavior. The key challenge is ensuring these commitments are credible (e.g., enforceable by legal or technical means) and determining whether such incentives would reliably motivate AI compliance. The author suggests that a legal entity (e.g., an AI lab) could structure these commitments, though details on enforcement remain unresolved. This approach aims to mitigate misalignment risks by creating mutually beneficial agreements with AIs lacking decisive strategic advantage.

Summary: Peter Salib argues that granting AIs certain legal rights (e.g., contracting, property ownership, litigation) could enhance human safety by aligning AI incentives with human interests, reducing the likelihood of harmful AI behavior. The discussion explores trade-offs between AI rights and safety measures, potential risks like proxy wars, and the broader implications of integrating AIs into legal and economic systems. This approach frames AI alignment as a legal and institutional challenge rather than purely a technical one.

### Unlearning Needs to be More Selective [Progress Report]
Source: AI Alignment Forum
Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/QYzofMbzmbgiwfqy8/unlearning-needs-to-be-more-selective-progress-report

Summary: The post highlights key challenges in LLM unlearning, noting that most methods superficially hide unwanted capabilities rather than removing them, as fine-tuning attacks often restore "forgotten" knowledge. The authors identify selectivity (e.g., Disruption Masking) and meta-learning (MAML) as promising for robust unlearning, emphasizing precise updates that avoid disrupting desired knowledge. They conclude that despite testing exotic methods, backpropagation remains the most effective tool for targeting weight updates. Implications for AI alignment include the need for more surgical unlearning techniques to ensure harmful capabilities are genuinely erased, not just suppressed.

### Jankily controlling superintelligence
Source: AI Alignment Forum
Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ainn5APCKHTFxuHKv/jankily-controlling-superintelligence

Summary: The post explores the idea of using imperfect control methods to modestly improve survival odds against misaligned superintelligent AI, even though such measures may only offer uncertain, limited risk reduction and focus on avoiding immediate catastrophes rather than ensuring beneficial outcomes. It highlights that risks escalate with AI capabilities due to factors like increased scheming likelihood and broader deployment affordances, while acknowledging uncertainty about how difficult control will be at superhuman levels. The author suggests that in scenarios where control proves easier than expected, basic measures might remain viable even for superintelligent systems, though this is far from guaranteed.  

(Key implications: Emphasizes the precariousness of relying on control for superintelligence, the importance of early risk mitigation, and the need to prepare for highly uncertain outcomes in AI alignment.)

### The need to relativise in debate 
Source: AI Alignment Forum
Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/XycoFucvxAPhcgJQa/the-need-to-relativise-in-debate-1

Summary: The post argues that AI safety techniques like debate or scalable oversight must "relativize"—meaning they should remain valid even when all parties have access to a black-box oracle (e.g., a powerful problem solver or human preference model). This requirement can alter the complexity class of the protocol, necessitating adjustments to restore the method's effectiveness. The discussion draws parallels to interactive proof systems (like IP = PSPACE) to illustrate how relativization impacts proof structures in AI alignment contexts.  

(Key ideas: Relativization ensures robustness against oracle access, complexity class shifts require protocol adaptations, and insights from interactive proofs inform AI safety solutions.)
