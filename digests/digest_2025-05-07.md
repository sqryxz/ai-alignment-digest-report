Summary: The post identifies five pivotal factors ("hinge-questions") that determine whether AGI arrives within 5-20 years, emphasizing quantitative disagreements over qualitative vibes. Key hinges include the role of recursive self-improvement (RSI), compute-to-value translation, and regulatory/supply-chain bottlenecks, with optimistic answers compressing timelines to 2026-2029 and pessimistic ones extending them past 2040. The analysis contrasts short-timeline (e.g., AI 2027) and long-timeline (e.g., Epoch, Zheng/Ramani) narratives, highlighting concrete empirical bets to resolve disputes. Implications for alignment include urgency (if RSI or economic thresholds are near) and the need for adaptive governance under uncertainty.
