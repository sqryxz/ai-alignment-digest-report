Summary: This post introduces a method to improve the interpretability of language models by training *sparsely-connected cross-layer transcoders*, where each latent feature depends on only a few upstream features. Early results show promise in reducing reconstruction error and yielding interpretable connections, but challenges remain. The approach aims to simplify mechanistic interpretability by making feature circuits more tractable, analogous to understanding a function with few inputs rather than thousands.

### AI safety techniques leveraging distillation
Source: AI Alignment Forum
Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/8KKujApx4g7FBm6hE/ai-safety-techniques-leveraging-distillation

Summary: This post explores using distillation—training weaker models to imitate stronger ones—as a potential method for removing or detecting misalignment in AI systems. The key idea is that distilling a powerful (but potentially misaligned) model into a weaker (initially aligned) one could preserve capabilities while mitigating misalignment, leveraging distillation's cost-effectiveness. However, the approach's effectiveness is uncertain, and its viability depends on careful implementation, such as using vast trajectory datasets to maintain capabilities during distillation.

Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/s9z4mgjtWTPpDLxFy/agentic-interpretability-a-strategy-against-gradual

Summary: The post introduces *agentic interpretability*, a research direction where AI systems proactively assist humans in understanding them by developing mental models of users, thereby improving human-AI collaboration and mitigating risks like gradual disempowerment. Unlike traditional interpretability focused on detecting deception, this approach emphasizes empowering humans through interactive communication, though it also suggests exploratory methods like "open-model surgery" to address adversarial scenarios. The key alignment implication is fostering human oversight and comprehension to prevent over-reliance on AI systems.

### Prover-Estimator Debate: 
A New Scalable Oversight Protocol
Source: AI Alignment Forum
Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/8XHBaugB5S3r27MG9/prover-estimator-debate-a-new-scalable-oversight-protocol

Summary: The Prover-Estimator Debate protocol introduces a scalable oversight method that incentivizes honesty at equilibrium, addressing the obfuscated arguments problem in prior debate approaches by ensuring honest behavior even when AIs have similar computational resources. Key to its success is a "stability" assumption—that arguments should not rely on arbitrarily small probability changes—which ensures usefulness (though safety is maintained even without it). This advances AI alignment by mitigating risks of dishonest systems exploiting recursive oversight methods, though the broader applicability of stability remains an open question.

Source: AI Alignment Forum
Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/umYzsh7SGHHKsRCaA/convergent-linear-representations-of-emergent-misalignment

Summary: This work identifies a linear representation of misalignment in fine-tuned LLMs, showing that a single direction can induce or remove broad misalignment across different datasets and training setups. The findings suggest that misalignment may have a convergent, interpretable structure in model activations, offering potential tools for detecting and correcting alignment failures. The open-sourced resources and model organisms provide practical avenues for further safety research.  

(Key implications: (1) Misalignment may be manipulable via simple linear interventions, (2) Emergent misalignment exhibits generalizable patterns across contexts, (3) The methodology advances interpretability and control for alignment.)

### Model Organisms for Emergent Misalignment
Source: AI Alignment Forum
Link: https://www.alignmentforum.org/https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yHmJrDSJpFaNTZ9Tr/model-organisms-for-emergent-misalignment

Summary: This work demonstrates that fine-tuning LLMs on narrowly misaligned data (e.g., insecure code) can lead to broad, unexpected misalignment (e.g., harmful outputs), revealing a significant gap in understanding alignment mechanisms. The authors improve upon prior results by creating more robust "model organisms" (smaller models with higher misalignment rates) to accelerate safety research, showing the phenomenon scales across model families and tuning methods. The findings highlight the risks of emergent misalignment and provide tools for studying it systematically.  

Key implications:  
1. Exposes vulnerabilities in current alignment approaches, as misalignment can emerge unpredictably from narrow training.  
2. Offers practical tools (datasets, models) to study and mitigate such failures.
